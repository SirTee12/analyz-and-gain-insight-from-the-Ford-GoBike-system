# Analysis of The Ford GoBike System Data
## By Ahmad Ayantola 


## Dataset
> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. This dataset was gottrn from one of Udacity's curated datasets. It consists of 16 columns with 180k+ records. The Ford GoBike system dataset provides anonymized, timestamped data about the start and end station for a bike, the duration of the ride, the user type (subscriber or customer), some customer-reported attributes like birth year and gender (the gender here is divide into three categories: male, female, other), as well as the the start and end time for each ride.

> The analysis of the data began with univariate exploration where individual variables are are analysed and investigated to gain insights and to see if there are areas that needs more investigation. Visuals depicting population of riders by gender and age group, ditribution of distance across all riders and proportion of customers to subscribers were drawn

> The next step was the bivariate exploration in which relationship between different variables were analyzed like the relatioship between gender and age, effect of gender on duration of ride, effect of age the the time of start of ride, effect of time of start of ride on distance travelled and effect of gender on distance travelled

> Next is the multivariate exploration that investigated the relationship between more than two variables. Effect of being a subscriber or customer on the distance travelled based on time of the day and effect gender on distance travelled based on age.

## Summary of Findings

+ Men form the bulk of users using the ford GoBike system as they account for more than 70% of the total users of the system
+ There are more subscriber (those who use the ford GoBike service frequently) than customer (those who use the service occassionally). The subscriber account for more than 90% of the total users
+ young people between ages of 16 - 39 years use their service more than other age groups
+ Majority of the users ride for less than 5km
+ Most Users are seen to ride for less than 20 minutes regardless of the gender.
+ There are more users of the ford gobike system between the hours of 7 - 10am and between 3 - 6pm 
+ time of start of ride is not a factor for riding longer distance or longer duration



## Key Insights for Presentation
+ Men are the majority users of the ford gobike system and most of them are young people
+ Gender is not a factor in determining duration and time of travel ( boxplots will be used instead of violin plot)
